## Task Overview
For this task, I utilized **the Code First Approach** with **MS SQL Server**. I approached this project as though it were a part of a larger, real-world application, which influenced the architectural and design decisions I made.

## Architectural Approach
I implemented **Clean Architecture** and adhered to **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles to ensure a robust, maintainable, and scalable solution.

## Design Patterns Applied
#### **Repository Pattern:** To abstract the data access layer and promote a clean separation of concerns.

#### **CQRS Pattern:** To separate the read and write operations, improving performance and scalability.
#### **Mediator Pattern:** To manage complex workflows and decouple dependencies between different parts of the application.
#### **Unit of Work Pattern:** To maintain consistency and integrity in database transactions.
and configure Dependency injection ...
## Authentication & Authorization
Considering that the application might require user roles and permissions, I just configured the candidate entity with ASP.NET Identity to handle authentication and authorization.

## Performance Optimization
**I implemented caching mechanisms**, designed to be compatible with Redis for future scalability. This will improve performance and reduce load on the database.

## Scalability Practices
To ensure the application can handle a large number of users, I implemented **pagination** and other best practices aimed at supporting scalability.

## Testing
I conducted thorough **Unit Testing** and  **Architecture Testing** to validate the functionality and structural integrity of the solution.

## Areas for Improvement
**Future Enhancements:** There are several areas where the project can be further improved, including the implementation of a more sophisticated logging system, enhancing the current caching strategy with *Redis* integration, and expanding the use of *background services* for tasks like email notifications.

Use **Dapper** for Reading and **EF Core** for Writing: To optimize performance, consider using Dapper for read operations due to its lightweight nature, while continuing to use EF Core for write operations to leverage its powerful *change-tracking* and *unit-of-work * features.

**API Documentation:** Additional detailed API documentation could be generated to improve the ease of integration for other developers and teams.
